# Titanic Survival Prediction with Python

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques in Python.

## Introduction

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, resulting in the deaths of a large number of passengers and crew. This project attempts to analyze passenger data and predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, sex, ticket class, and more.

## Notebook

All detailed explanations, data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation are provided in the Jupyter Notebook `titaniv_ML_competition_VF.ipynb`. Please refer to this notebook for a step-by-step walkthrough of the project.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is available in the file `train.csv` and `test.csv`. These files contain information about Titanic passengers such as their age, sex, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether they survived or not. The goal is to train a machine learning model using the training dataset (`train.csv`) and make predictions on the test dataset (`test.csv`).
